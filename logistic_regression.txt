# Logistic Regression
* Linear regression is for linear model
* Others models:
	1. Quadratic
	2. Exponential
	3. Logistic (Predict [target, outcome] categorical data (Y or N) (will buy or will not buy))

* formal defination: The logistic regression predicts the probability of an event occuring
* Why logistic as name? Because of logistic function
* Useful for binary prediction
* p(x) = e^(b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk)/1(+e^(b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk))
* p(x)/(1-p(x)) = e^(b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk) = probability of occuring/ probability of not occuring
* log(p(x)/(1-p(x))) = log(e^(b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk)) = b0 + b1x1 + ... + bkxk = log(odds) --- Logit model

# Odds of getting ...
* Rolling a dice:
	- getting a six = 1/6
	- odds of getting a six = p(getting a six)/p(not getting a six) = (1/6)/(5/6) = 1/5
